# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

# Stage-1: Terraform Validate Stage
## Step-1: Publish Artifacts to Pipeline (Pipeline artifacts provide a way to share files between stages in a pipeline or between different pipelines. )
## Step-2: Install Latest Terraform (0.13.5) (Ideally not needed if we use default Ubuntu Agents)
## Step-3: Validate Terraform Manifests (terraform init, terraform validate)

stages:
  - stage: TerraformValidate
    displayName: Terraform Validate
    jobs:
      - job: TerraformValidate
        displayName: Terraform Validate
        steps:
           - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
             displayName: Publish Artifcats to Pipeline
             inputs:
               targetPath: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/terraform-manifest'
               artifact: 'terraform-manifest'
               publishLocation: 'pipeline'
            
           - task: TerraformInstaller@0
             displayName: Terraform Install
             inputs:
               terraformVersion: 'latest'
